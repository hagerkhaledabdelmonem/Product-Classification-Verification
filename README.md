# Product-Classification-Verification

Product classification and recognition is important task to automate tasks such as inventory management, pricing. For example, a retailer could use this technology to automatically identify and classify products in a store, and then use this information to update inventory levels, calculate products prices, and provide with information about the products.

### Objectives:
1. Apply Image preprocessing or Feature Extraction techniques where needed.
2. Train classification models to determine the product category.
3. Using Classical computer vision or deep learning.
4. Train a one/few shot learning model (e.g., Siamese) to verify if a product exists and recognize its type.
5. Apply Data Preparation steps :
    - Image Preprocessing :
    
      - Convert image from BGR to RGB
      - Resizing Images
      - Normalize Image by Dividing by Maximum
    
    - Data Augmentation For Train Like:
    
      - Horizontal flip
      - Vertical flip
      - Rotation range by 40
      - Width shift range
      - Height shift range
      - Zoom range
      - Fill mode by Nearest
6. Apply OneHotEncoder to convert Classes to labels
7. Split into train and validation


### Classical computer vision
Using a feature extraction method first (BoW using SIFT) and then use logistic regression as classifier. 

### Deep learning Models pretrained on ImageNet dataset like :
  - Xception
  - DenseNet
  - MobileNet
  - CNN
